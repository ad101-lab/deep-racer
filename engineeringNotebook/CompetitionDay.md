# Competition day

Our notebooking and takeaways from competition day.

## Morning training

Oliver trained a model with no Zig Zag and we got 3 full completions virtual 22 seconds each. We did not get a chance to test this model.

## Runs

### Monza testing

We tested a lot on monza and we ended up getting some good models with great speeds and reliabilities, and we were able to test a lot of our new models on this track, and eliminate the really bad models.

### Oval testing

We tested a few of our models on oval, but we were limited in what we tested so we were only able to test the promote straightness 15 - 30 full speed and promote straightness 15 - 30 clone oval with oval training. The full speed one was very fast, but it did go off the track 2 times at the end of the run. 

Our notebooking from the runs that we did throughout the day

## Competition runs

### Monza

#### Run 1

Using promote straightness 15-30 degrees trained on monza then copied to oval and tested more because of how well it ran on both monza and oval. We ran this at 92% for a conservative speed, but we adjusted it as we went on.

Results:

We got a time of 16 seconds
We got 4.5 laps, it went off on the zig zag part, but overall it went really well.

At the time this placed us in first

#### Run 2

We are going to use our second clone of the promote straightness and stay near centerline on our second attempt because of the speed that it goes at. We will run this at 100% speed because we are going for the fastest lap time in this trial.

Results:

We got 10 laps
And a 14.00 second lap time

Overall a big success, tried increasing the speed a bit too much so we lost it.

#### Run 3

We are going to tune our car so that we can get it even faster and see how fast as we can go.

#### Run 4

We are just going to try and see how fast we can go.

### Oval

#### Run 1

Using promote straightness 15-30 degrees trained on monza then copied to oval and tested more because of how well it ran on both monza and oval. We ran this at 92% for a conservative speed, but we adjusted it as we went on.

Results:

We got a time of 21 (They stopped the timer way late)
We got 9.5 laps

We were unhappy with our lap time, but our lap count we are very happy with.

#### Run 2

We already have a ton of laps on this track, but our speed is not the best, so we are going to run one of our fast models to try and get the best time.

#### Run 3

After this run we are going to optimise it so that we can get the fastest speed possible, hopefully like sub 13 seconds. 

#### Run 4

We plan to try and optimize the car some more so we can get the fastest time possible, or try and get the most laps, depending on what the other competitors get.


Some of  this notebooking got cut short because of time limitations.
