# Creating and training a model

## Create model

### Name your model

* Name your model descriptively
* Make a good desciption, it will save time and resources

### Choosing a track

* Choose the Monza or the Oval track

## Defining action space

### Selecting action space

#### Descrete action space

* Multiple discrete outputs for your model
* Customizeable

#### Continous action space

* Your car can choose from a continous group of actions
* Takes longer to train, but can have better results

## Choosing a car

* Use the default car
* I changed the color on my car so I could see it better

## Reward function

* The function that determines the preformance of the different models
* This determines a lot of how your model acts in its enviroment
* More information on our reward function [Reward function](RewardFunction.md)

## Training

* Train for an hour to straddle the overtraining/undertraining balance
* Possibly record the output so you can have more data on how your model preforms
* Look through the logs after the model is done training

## Evalutation

* We will always evaluate our models and record it
* This will really help our models become the best they can be.
